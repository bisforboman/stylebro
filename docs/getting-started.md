# Getting started

From install to the first `dotnet format` run. Pick the path that fits:

- [A. A new project, or no StyleCop](#a-a-new-project-or-no-stylecop)
- [B. Coming from StyleCop](#b-coming-from-stylecop)

Both use two packages: **StyleBro.Analyzers** (the rules, referenced by your projects) and **StyleBro.Migrate** (the
`stylebro-migrate` command line tool, used once to write settings):

```
dotnet tool install --global StyleBro.Migrate --prerelease
```

`stylebro-migrate init` and `stylebro-migrate format` are newer than the latest release (0.1.0-alpha.8). Until the next
one, run them from a clone of this repository: `dotnet run --project src/StyleBro.Migrate -- init --write`.

## A. A new project, or no StyleCop

### 1. Add the package

Add it to every project, for example in `Directory.Build.props` at the repository root:

```xml
<Project>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="StyleBro.Analyzers" Version="0.1.0-alpha.8" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

With central package management, the version goes in `Directory.Packages.props` and the reference has none:

```xml
<!-- Directory.Packages.props -->
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageVersion Include="StyleBro.Analyzers" Version="0.1.0-alpha.8" />
</ItemGroup>

<!-- Directory.Build.props -->
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="StyleBro.Analyzers" PrivateAssets="all" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The package brings StyleBro's rules and its preset: rule severities and formatting options, close to StyleCop's
defaults. Your own `.editorconfig` wins over the preset. To configure everything yourself instead:
`<StyleBroPreset>none</StyleBroPreset>`.

### 2. Turn on the built-in rules

StyleBro relies on some built-in .NET rules (IDE0055 formatting, IDE0036 modifier order, IDE0065 using placement, ...).
Their severities have to be in `.editorconfig`, because `dotnet format` ignores rule severities in a package's preset.
In the repository root:

```
stylebro-migrate init            # shows the block
stylebro-migrate init --write    # adds it to .editorconfig (created if missing)
```

The block sits between `# BEGIN stylebro-migrate` and `# END stylebro-migrate`; running the command again replaces it.
Put your own settings outside it. To get these rules reported by the build too, add
`<EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>true</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>` to `Directory.Build.props`.

### 3. Run dotnet format

```
dotnet format
```

This fixes whitespace, the built-in rules and every StyleBro rule in one go. A second run should change nothing.
Review the diff and commit it. In a large codebase you may not want one big change: see
[Large codebases](#large-codebases).

### 4. Check it in CI

Run `dotnet format --verify-no-changes --severity warn` after the build: it fails when `dotnet format` would change a
file. Set-up for GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines: [ci.md](ci.md).

## B. Coming from StyleCop

`stylebro-migrate` reads your StyleCop setup (rulesets, global configs, `.editorconfig` files, `stylecop.json`) and
writes StyleBro and SDK settings that enforce the same things, so code StyleCop was happy with stays as it is. A
walk-through on a small project, with real output: [samples/StyleCopMigration](../samples/StyleCopMigration/README.md).

### 1. Dry run

```
stylebro-migrate path/to/repo
```

It prints what it read, the settings it would write, and the StyleCop rules nothing enforces after the switch (dropped
by design, partly covered, or not covered yet). Nothing is changed.

### 2. Write the settings

```
stylebro-migrate path/to/repo --write
```

This writes the settings into your `.editorconfig` files (between the `stylebro-migrate` markers), turns StyleBro's
preset off in the root `Directory.Build.props` (the settings replace it), and adds the replacing rule ids to existing
StyleCop suppressions (`#pragma warning disable`, `[SuppressMessage]`, `<NoWarn>`). You don't need `init` after this:
the block includes the built-in rules.

### 3. Swap the package

Remove the `StyleCop.Analyzers` reference and add `StyleBro.Analyzers` instead, as in [path A, step 1](#1-add-the-package).
`stylecop.json` and the StyleCop suppressions can stay; StyleBro ignores them.

### 4. Run dotnet format

```
dotnet format
```

In a StyleCop-clean repository this should change little or nothing. Look at what it did change: usually code StyleCop
missed, or a rule where StyleBro deliberately differs ([differences-from-stylecop.md](differences-from-stylecop.md)).
Then check the report from step 1 for rules your team relied on that nothing enforces any more. Details:
[migrating.md](migrating.md). CI: [ci.md](ci.md).

## Newer C# and APIs (optional)

To also rewrite code into newer C# and newer APIs (target-typed `new()`, collection expressions, file-scoped
namespaces, `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`, ...) with the SDK's own rules, after either path:

```
stylebro-migrate init --modernize --write
dotnet format
```

In multi-targeted projects, StyleBro's multi-target guard hides the newer-API rules where a target framework lacks the
API, and the newer-C# rules are suggestions unless the project sets `LangVersion`. Tiers, examples and the rules left out:
[modernizing.md](modernizing.md).

## Multi-targeted repositories

If any project sets several `<TargetFrameworks>`, use `stylebro-migrate format` wherever this page says
`dotnet format`. It takes the same arguments and options:

```
stylebro-migrate format
stylebro-migrate format MySolution.sln --verify-no-changes --severity warn
```

Plain `dotnet format` crashes there on the SDK's formatting fix (IDE0055) without writing anything. The command runs
`dotnet format` once per target framework instead; without multi-targeted projects it's one plain run. Why:
[ci.md](ci.md#notes). `stylebro-migrate init` tells you when it finds such projects.

## Large codebases

If `dotnet format` would change too much at once, record today's violations in a baseline instead:

```
stylebro-migrate baseline                            # in the folder with your solution
stylebro-migrate baseline --project MySolution.sln   # or name it
```

This writes `stylebro.baseline`; commit it. The build, the IDE and `dotnet format` then ignore those violations, and
only new code has to follow the rules. A baseline can't hide whitespace formatting. Details: [baseline.md](baseline.md).
