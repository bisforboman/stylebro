# Analyzer benchmark

Times analyzers the way the compiler's `ReportAnalyzer` does (each analyzer's own execution time), but without the
noise of a full build: one compilation of a folder of sources, all analyzers together, single-threaded, the median of
several runs after a warm-up run.

```bash
dotnet build src/StyleBro.Analyzers
dotnet run -c Release --project scripts/benchmark -- src/StyleBro.Analyzers/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/StyleBro.Analyzers.dll path/to/sources 5
```

The optional fourth argument sets preprocessor symbols (`HAVE_ASYNC;NET8_0`). Missing references don't matter much:
the sources are compiled against the .NET runtime only, so code using other packages binds partly. Compare two builds
of the analyzers on the same sources rather than reading the absolute numbers.

## Results (2026-10-02, Newtonsoft.Json's main project, 242 files)

| | All analyzers | Slowest |
|---|---|---|
| StyleBro 0.1.0-alpha.8 | 1,096 ms | FieldNamingAnalyzer 468 ms |
| StyleBro after caching type facts in FieldNamingAnalyzer | ~800 ms | DocumentationAnalyzer ~160 ms, FieldNamingAnalyzer ~150 ms |
| StyleCop.Analyzers 1.2.0-beta.556 (182 analyzers) | 1,671 ms | SA1121 152 ms, SA1101 108 ms |

Single runs vary by about 20%. In real builds the analyzers run concurrently with each other and with the compiler,
so the wall-clock cost is smaller: the private 30-project app built in the same time with and without StyleBro.
